### I don't think i was perfect volunteer, truly I really loved each one of you. Every centimeter of Rdestowa ,s full of memories for me (perhaps because I sweeped way broom also there), about weird adventures I lived in Poland. I pooped in the middle of a street in Gdansk, bullied kids in my own workplace, had the deepest conversations about love, life and philosophy with random drunk people during the nights.

#

### Poland is out of mind a perfect square in which tradition and modernity and culture and craziness Mench and this house full of random details about our adventures here perfectly represents the amazing spirit of volunteering life.

### Please take care of it. Be careful about cleaning and enjoy every single moment, you will have the possibility to leave during your experience, I left by one through the people I met here and forward we think isnâ€™t any bigger gift than-it.
