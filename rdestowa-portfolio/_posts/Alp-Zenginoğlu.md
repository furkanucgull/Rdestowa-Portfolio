### Let me tell you first, my dear friend, reading this this project you are part of the flat you living in and every moment you will have will be a big experience and great memories when the project ends.

### Rdestowa is the prettiest house among others this flat the many memories, friendships challenges, and good times have made me who I am today I am very thankful for everything I have experienced and everyone I met. I had a greed mentor who helped me a lot. I had wonderful friends always ready to talk. Listen and have fun together.

### I was brave going alone to Norway planning to camp randomly meeting with two strangers in the forest and staying there for four days with huge parties. I was lucky to every person I met and, I had felt almost perfect. I don’t think I will forget what I learned here and the friendships I made while here I learned to talk with people about deep topics meet new ones ask "what can I learn from this" during hard times cook for people go on unexpected hikes love people and show, whoever read this, I am sure this project will be on forgettable experience for making you better always will you people and show your love and don’t change yourself for people
