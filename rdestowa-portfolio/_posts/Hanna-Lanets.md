## Bedroom : Downstairs

#

### I had a luck to experience some volunteers time after my volunteering year and I have a bigger luck to experience this time here in this heaven.

#

### So what can I say it’s have some to make some volunteering experience. It’s more of some for me to make it in Gdynia,

### It’s important to go to the beach to see a sunrise. It’s nice to go to Baby Doły at least one time during your time here enjoy forest here they like you and save you.

### Wild pigs are like dogs here but remember to leave them there in the city open your heart for new people and experiences, and they will come in your live. Warmly hug you and wish you YOUR volunteering year !
