I am very grateful for all the people I met here and all the time I spent in this apartment I loved all the coffees and the meals together. I hope you guys keep enjoy being here and remember it for for a long time please keep making cakes the apartment fields, some kind warmer. Don’t worry about cleaning too much clean enough when you have time andI will stop nagging and I will miss you a lot
