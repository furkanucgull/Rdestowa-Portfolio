### I lived in this flat for almost a year today I got my Polish visa in 2021 is the day I rented my own flat were in 2022. I guess I grew as a person so I have gotten more toxic volunteering is like a second teenagehood and you should take advantage of that.

#

### Tips:

## Always ask for stuff to be fixed when stuff is broken. Don’t fuck up the dishwasher. We are the only flat who has one explore sheet and don’t overthink. If you need any tips about public transport reach out me.
